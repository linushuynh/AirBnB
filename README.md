## About Overnight S&S

### An AirBnB Clone
Overnight S&S is a clone of AirBnB and rather than BnB's bed and breakfast, S&S stands for Overnight Sofa & Supper
The live site is located at: https://overnightsns.herokuapp.com/

* Sequelize
* Express
* React
* Redux

The link to the wiki can be found at: https://github.com/linushuynh/Overnight-Sofa-N-Supper/wiki

Various features can be tested through the Demo-User.
First log-in in the top right and then you can go to Manage your listings. From there you will be able to create your own listing and edit as well as delete it.
Not only that, you can visit other listings on the main page(accessible through clicking the top left Overnight S&S text). 
While you visit other listings, you will see other people's reviews and can leave your own as well. If you change your mind about the review, you can delete it right away.
The beauty of this project lies in its simplicity and speed.
